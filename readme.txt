Explanation:

The code starts by loading environment variables from a .env file using the dotenv library.
It sets up the connection to the Ethereum/TRC20 network using the web3 library and the ETHEREUM_NODE_URL environment variable.
The code defines the wallet addresses for the Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet, and the Business Pay Wallet.
It also sets up the contract details, including the contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface).
The monetize_funds function is the main entry point for the monetizing software. It takes the amount of funds to be monetized as an argument, verifies the funds using the blockchain, and then withdraws and sends the funds to the user's wallet.
The verify_funds function calls the contract function to verify the funds using the blockchain.
The withdraw_and_send function withdraws the funds from the Business Pay Wallet and sends them to the user's wallet (either Trust Wallet or Binance Wallet) using the TRC20 network.
The send_to_trust_wallet and send_to_binance_wallet functions use the respective wallet APIs to send the funds to the user's wallet.
Note: This code assumes that you have set up the necessary environment variables and have the required API keys for the Trust Wallet and Binance Wallet APIs. You will also
